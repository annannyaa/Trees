Given a generic tree, find and return the node with second largest value in given tree.
Note: Return NULL if no node with required value is present.

approch 1: find the max element and replace it with -inf and then find the max element again.
prob: 1. if all the elements are the same, then the traversals=no.of nodes and time complexity messed up.
      2. don't change the input data
approch 2: custom copy approach
approach 3: keep a custom: max and smax. check if ele. likes b/w max and smax. if below smax: don;t worry. if b/w: update smax. if above: smax=max and ele= new max.
